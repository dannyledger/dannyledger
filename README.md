## Hi there, I'm Danny 😊🤙


🌏 A New Zealand–based User Researcher with over 10 years of senior-level experience helping organisations understand people, shape better products, and make confident decisions.

⚗ Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into data analysis and building up my skills in data science, swapping out miro boards for Jupyter notebooks.

🏝 Outside of work, I’m usually at the beach with my daughter, chasing waves, sunshine, and that mythic work–life balance.

📚 Whilst I'm comfortable with basic Python and SQL, I’m currently learning ...
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn - primarily through trial and error.
- Essential Math and Statistics required for DataSci - primarily through books and bootcamps.
- The initial steps into Machine Learning and Deep Learning - primarily through watching lectures and going 'huh' alot.
