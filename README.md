## Hi there, I'm Danny 😊🤙


🌏 An Auckland–based researcher with over 15 years experience helping organisations understand how people think and operate. 

⚗ Lately, I’ve been building on my data analysis skills and evolving them into a data science toolkit.

📚 Whilst I'm comfortable with basic Python and SQL, I’m currently learning...
- python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn - primarily through trial and error.
- the essential Math and Statistics required for DataSci - primarily through books and bootcamps.
- the initial steps into Machine Learning and Deep Learning - primarily through watching lectures and going '_huh_' alot. 

🏝 Outside of work, I’m usually at the beach with my family, chasing waves, sunshine, and that mythic work–life balance.
