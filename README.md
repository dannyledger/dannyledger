## Hi there, I'm Danny 😊🤙


🌏 An Auckland–based researcher with over 15 years experience helping organisations understand how people think and operate. 

⚗ Lately, I’ve been building on my technical skills and evolving them into a hybrid data engineering and analysis toolkit.

📚 I have learned or am currently learning...
- the critical methods and tooling of a data engineer - aiming to build and automate scalable data pipelines.
- python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy and Statsmodels - primarily through trial and error.
- the essential Math and Statistics required for analysis - primarily through books and bootcamps.
- the initial steps into Machine Learning and Deep Learning - primarily through watching lectures and going '_huh_' a lot. 

🏝 Outside of work, I’m usually at the beach with my family, chasing waves, sunshine, and that mythic work–life balance.
